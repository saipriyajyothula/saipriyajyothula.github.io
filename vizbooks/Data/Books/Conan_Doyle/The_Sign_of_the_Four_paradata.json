After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper.  In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night.  She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey.  She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of selfrestraint which held me back.  My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden.  I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences.  Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips.  She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time.  Worse still, she was rich.  If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.  Was it fair, was it honorable, that a halfpay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about?  Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortuneseeker?  I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind.  This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.",

He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him.  He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house.  There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen.  Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died.  Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his deathbed.  In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons.  Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card.  He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal.  Do you follow all this?",

As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off.  The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.  By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the wellknown member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm.  His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.  It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's wellknown technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trapdoor into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found.  This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary.  The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind.  We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.",

So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree.  They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stoneheaded clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows.  These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.'  Nice, amiable people, Watson!

Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat.  It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so.

"value":"At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us.  It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards.  She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night.  Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along.  We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs.  The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora.  Jones turned our searchlight upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck.  One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped.  Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog.  The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life.  They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it.  At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them.  At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty.  I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying manhunt down the Thames.  Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard.  In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery.  The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us.  Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop.  We were not more than four boat's lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.  It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other.  At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a goodsized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side.  At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.  It straightened itself into a little black manthe smallest I have ever seenwith a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.  Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature.  He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night.  Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty.  His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.",

Our pistols rang out together.  He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream.  I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.  At the same moment the woodenlegged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet.  We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marshland, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation.  The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mudbank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil.  In vain he struggled and writhed.  Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards.  He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank.  When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side.  The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded.  The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern.  A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck.  This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the illomened treasure of the Sholtos.  There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin.

One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell.  Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line.  I only know what I saw with my own eyes.  Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces.  Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops.  Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man.  He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up.  There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskeypegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him.  Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the bookwork and the managing.  Well, one fine day the crash came.  I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah.  I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.  A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him.  I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof.  I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter.  From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house.  Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddyfields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.",
