Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring. \u00a0I set still and listened. \u00a0Directly I could just barely hear a me-yow! me-yow! down there. \u00a0That was good! \u00a0Says I, me-yow! me-yow! as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. \u00a0Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me."

This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. \u00a0I was itching in eleven different places now. \u00a0I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. \u00a0Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.",
                        "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. \u00a0When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. \u00a0But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. \u00a0I didn't want him to try. \u00a0I said Jim might wake up and come. \u00a0But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. \u00a0I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.",
                        "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. \u00a0Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. \u00a0And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. \u00a0Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. \u00a0Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. \u00a0Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. \u00a0Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, Hm! \u00a0What you know 'bout witches? and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. \u00a0Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. \u00a0Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. \u00a0Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.",
                        "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. \u00a0We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. \u00a0So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.",
                        "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. \u00a0Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. \u00a0We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. \u00a0We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. \u00a0Tom says:"

They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. \u00a0Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? \u00a0It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. \u00a0I says I'll never vote agin. \u00a0Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live. \u00a0And to see the cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. \u00a0I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know. \u00a0And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. \u00a0There, now--that's a specimen. \u00a0They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. \u00a0Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and--",
                        "Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. \u00a0He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. \u00a0But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. \u00a0He said so his own self afterwards. \u00a0He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.",
                        "After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. \u00a0That was always his word. \u00a0I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. \u00a0He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. \u00a0He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. \u00a0He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. \u00a0At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.",
                        "I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. \u00a0There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. \u00a0He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes. \u00a0He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck! \u00a0I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. \u00a0He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. \u00a0Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. \u00a0I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. \u00a0He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. \u00a0He says, very low:",
                        "Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming after me; but I won't go. \u00a0Oh, they're here! don't touch me--don't! hands off--they're cold; let go. \u00a0Oh, let a poor devil alone!",
                        "Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. \u00a0I could hear him through the blanket.",
                        "By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. \u00a0He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more. \u00a0I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. \u00a0Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.",
                        "So he dozed off pretty soon. \u00a0By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. \u00a0I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir. \u00a0And how slow and still the time did drag along."

                        "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. \u00a0By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested. \u00a0They squeaked through underneath. \u00a0There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. \u00a0On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.",
                        "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. \u00a0It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. \u00a0There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. \u00a0One was a big family Bible full of pictures. \u00a0One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't say why. \u00a0I read considerable in it now and then. \u00a0The statements was interesting, but tough. \u00a0Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry. \u00a0Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. \u00a0There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. \u00a0And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.",
                        "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called Signing the Declaration. There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. \u00a0They was different from any pictures I ever see before--blacker, mostly, than is common. \u00a0One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.  \u00a0Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.  \u00a0There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas. \u00a0These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. \u00a0Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. \u00a0But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. \u00a0She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. \u00a0It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. \u00a0Other times it was hid with a little curtain. \u00a0The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me."

The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. \u00a0The Shepherdsons done the same. \u00a0It was pretty ornery preaching--all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.",
                        "About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. \u00a0Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. \u00a0I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. \u00a0I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. \u00a0Then she said she'd forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. \u00a0I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool. \u00a0If you notice, most folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.",
                        "Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. \u00a0So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with HALF-PAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil. \u00a0I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. \u00a0I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. \u00a0She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. \u00a0She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. \u00a0I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her no, only coarse-hand, and then she said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.",
                        "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. \u00a0When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says:",

                        "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.",
                        "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows. \u00a0These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.",
                        "One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. \u00a0I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. \u00a0I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs a-coming. \u00a0They wanted to jump right in, but I says:",
                        "Don't you do it. \u00a0I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs off the scent."

                        "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. \u00a0He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. \u00a0And he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. \u00a0He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was, Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart--and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. \u00a0Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.",
                        "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for, because it was for us. \u00a0It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and $200 reward under it. \u00a0The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. \u00a0It said he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.",
                        "Now, says the duke, after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. \u00a0Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. \u00a0Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. \u00a0Too much like jewelry. \u00a0Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards."

I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. \u00a0So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately. \u00a0I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. \u00a0I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I _was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. \u00a0He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him.",

                        "Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. \u00a0Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. \u00a0So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.",
                        "Then they come out and locked him up. \u00a0I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger."
