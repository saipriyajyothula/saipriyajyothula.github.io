                        "He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and right noisily, too. \u00a0They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}--that is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.",
                        "The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with native dignity--",
                        "Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him.",
                        "A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--",
                        "Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?",
                        "The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip, but there was nothing there. \u00a0There was a storm of laughter, and one boy said--",
                        "Didst mark that? \u00a0He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince himself.",
                        "This sally brought more laughter. \u00a0Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said--"

                        "The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag's feet to the floor where she stood, and almost took her breath. \u00a0She stared at the Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst into a roar of laughter. \u00a0But the effect upon Tom Canty's mother and sisters was different. \u00a0Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort. \u00a0They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces, exclaiming--",

Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which were disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also, that it was a pleasure to behold.'",

The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously, and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter. Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury. \u00a0Tears of mortification sprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally. \u00a0Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he exclaimed--"

The boon was granted, as your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day, the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King's Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do. {3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient reward--and none other, to wit: \u00a0that I and my heirs, for ever, may _sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!",

                        "Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon and the King passed a troubled night. \u00a0For a bribe the jailer had furnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs, fighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. \u00a0At last, a while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by beating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could come to the rescue. \u00a0The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased; and after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.",
                        "During the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous sameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less distinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the 'impostor' and repudiate and insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with symmetrical regularity. \u00a0However, there was a change of incident at last. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--",
                        "The villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou canst say which is he.",
                        "Hendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first time since he had been in the jail. \u00a0He said to himself, This is Blake Andrews, a servant all his life in my father's family--a good honest soul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. \u00a0But none are true now; all are liars. \u00a0This man will know me--and will deny me, too, like the rest.",
                        "The old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and finally said--",
                        "I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o' the streets. \u00a0Which is he?",
                        "The jailer laughed."

                        "This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man's gossip. He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the beggar-boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace. \u00a0It did not seem possible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be driven out, and search made for the true prince. \u00a0Could it be that the Court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? \u00a0No, for his uncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a movement, of course. \u00a0The boy's musings profited him nothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. \u00a0His impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost unendurable.",

                        "The mock King's cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. \u00a0At this point, just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught sight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of the second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. \u00a0A sickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his mother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old involuntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit. \u00a0In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards, and was at his side. \u00a0She embraced his leg, she covered it with kisses, she cried, O my child, my darling! lifting toward him a face that was transfigured with joy and love. \u00a0The same instant an officer of the King's Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm. \u00a0The words I do not know you, woman! were falling from Tom Canty's lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. \u00a0His grandeurs were stricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.",
                        "The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were as if they had not been. \u00a0He neither saw nor heard. \u00a0Royalty had lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach. \u00a0Remorse was eating his heart out. \u00a0He said, Would God I were free of my captivity!",
                        "He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days of his compulsory greatness.",
                        "The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes, seeing only his mother's face and that wounded look in it.",
                        "Largess, largess! \u00a0The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.",
                        "Long live Edward of England! \u00a0It seemed as if the earth shook with the explosion; but there was no response from the King. \u00a0He heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a great distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still nearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which kept repeating those shameful words, I do not know you, woman!",
                        "The words smote upon the King's soul as the strokes of a funeral bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone."
