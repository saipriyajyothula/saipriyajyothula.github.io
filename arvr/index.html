                        <h3>Smart phone/tablet AR</h3>
                            <br><h4>Advantages</h4>
                                <p><br>+ Smart phone/tablet AR enhances the actual environment by overlapping a layer of virtual information on top of it – we can use contextual data such as location and orientation to provide even richer experience in real time. <br>+ Since smart phones and tablets are already embedded in our everyday lives, the user will not need any additional equipment for the experience.</p>
                            <br><h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                                <p><br>- Since handheld devices such as smart phones/tablets are usually small, the experience is limited by the screen size of the device. The user can only view the virtual information via the device screen and he/she has to point the device camera at a position or object to view the information.</p>
                            <br><h4>Best suited applications</h4>
                                <p><br>&#x2605; Smart phone/tablet AR is well suited for applications that make use of location data/computer vision to provide context based information. A good example would be an application which uses location data to annotate surrounding historically significant/prominent buildings around the user.</p>

                        <h3>360&deg; video</h3>
                            <br><h4>Advantages</h4>
                                <p><br>+ In 360&deg; video, the user can look in all directions at a given point of time in the video; this means the user will have a more immersive experience when compared to traditional video where he/she can only see one direction at a given point of time.</p>
                            <br><h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                                <p><br>- The user is limited by the viewpoint of the camera; he/she can only see what the camera sees and hence the experience is not interactive/exploratory.<br>- 360&deg; video is monoscopic, this means that it’s just a 2D video taken in all directions: the user will not have perception of depth from the video.</p>
                            <br><h4>Best suited applications</h4>
                                <p><br>&#x2605; 360&deg; video is ideal for recording videos of special events like sports/celebrations where the action is not limited a single direction but things are happening in multiple directions at the same time.</p>
