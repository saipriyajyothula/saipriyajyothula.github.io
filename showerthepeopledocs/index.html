                        <br><img src="img/1.png" style="width:100%;height:100%"></br>
                            <br><br><p>The controls of the application are straightforward and easy to use. Each of the controls is described below:</p>
                            <BR><h4>Power and flow control:</h4>
                            <br><img src="img/2.png" style="width:60%;height:60%"></br></br>
                            <p><br>- The power button can be used to switch on or off the water flow; Initially, the water flow is set to low and the user can use the flow control buttons to either increase or decrease the water flow. The feedback is provided to the user by the change in colors of the flow control buttons.</p>
                            <BR><h4>Temperature Control:</h4>
                            <br><img src="img/3.png" style="width:60%;height:60%"></br></br>
                            <br><img src="img/4.png" style="width:100%;height:100%"></br></br>
                            <p>- The up and down arrows can be used to increase and decrease the water temperature respectively.<br>- The water temperature is displayed in the middle and the user has the option to change the units of the temperature to either C or F.<br>- A warning sign pops up when the water temperature is too high.</p>
                            <br><h4>Shower/Bath Control:</h4>
                            <br><img src="img/5.png" style="width:60%;height:60%"></br></br>
                            <p>- The shower/bath control can be used to toggle the water between the shower and bathtub.</p></br><p>- The position of the control toggles between the reach of shower and bathtub when it is pressed. For example, if the user chooses the bathtub option, the control moves down and moves back up when the user chooses the shower again.</p></br>

                        <h3>New Users</h3><br>
                        <h4>Pros:</h4>
                        <br><p>The shower design makes it easier for new users to figure out how to use the showerhead to change the spray direction and the markers on the showerhead assist the user in changing the type of spray. The user interface of the shower trim makes it easier for the users to adjust the water temperature – the initials H and C are straightforward and can be related to Hot and Cold respectively.</p></br>
                        <h4>Cons:</h4>
                        <br><p>The main flaw in the interface comes up when the user tries to start the water flow. The fact that the shower trim can be pulled out to start the water is not apparent to the new user – the knob gives the sense that it can be rotated to change the water temperature but the fact that it can also be used to change the amount of water by pull-and-push motion is not obvious.<br>The other significant problem with the interface is the mapping of the diverter. As the diverter is placed on top of the tap, it gives the false sense that it is somehow related to controlling the tap instead of its intended use which is to divert the water flow from tap to shower or vice versa.<br>Lastly, the fact that the cap on the shower trim can be used to block the drain hole for bath is not evident to a new user – the design is not easily discernable.

                        <h3>Regular Users</h3><br>
                        <h4>Pros:</h4>
                        <br><p>The user is required to rotate the shower trim as opposed to using a sliding control or a switch to change the water temperature. Rotating the shower trim requires conscious effort on the part of the user as he/she needs to apply torque on the knob – this ensures that there is no change in the temperature due to accidental movements of the user. Also, the change in the water temperature is gradual, this makes certain that the user is relatively safe from sudden outbursts of extremely hot or cold water.</p>                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>The water flows out of shower (upper faucet) and tap (lower faucet) when the diverter is pulled up and pushed down respectively.</li>
                            <li>The water comes out when the shower trim is pulled out and stops when it is pushed in.</li></ol>
            <p>These two mappings of cause-and-effect movements align with our sensorimotor perception of the world.</p>
            <p>The positioning of the controls on the showerhead and shower trim makes sense – the mapping of these controls correspond to the physical aspects they control. For example, the shower trim is placed between the showerhead and tap – this arrangement makes sense as it controls both.</p></br>
                        <h4>Cons:</h4>
                        <br><p>In case the user slips, there are no accommodations for support such as handles to regain the balance. Also, the surface of the bathtub is smooth, which results in increased cases of slip-and-fall.<br>The cap on the shower trim cannot be removed with ease; the design can be improved to make it easily removable.
