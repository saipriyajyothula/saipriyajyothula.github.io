## Pug
[Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug), formerly known as Jade, is a cool HTML templating language which saves a lot of typing.

## Node.js
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then open a command prompt in the project directory and type `npm install` to install required packages.

## Start watching for changes
Type `npm start` which will start watching index.pug for changes and automatically re-compile when needed. Then refresh the index.html file in a browser as usual to see changes.
